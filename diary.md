On the first day I started with using the template and deleting everything unnecessary for my game. On the second day, I continued with it by first asking Florian for help about my nuts appearing
I then continued with my input, the difficult part for me was doing the click function.

### 14/1/25
I struggled with some things, where in the end it were just small mistakes i did like not linking the js files or forgetting .js when importing
stuff etc. After that got sorted out with Florian I could focus on other parts of my game.

15.1. In the beginning I got help from Lukas that the different nuts i have can also have images as well as 
when clicking on them, that they dissapear. The issue was that my canvas was too small etc.

16.1. Today I fixed my animation, that it reacts to collected nuts as well as has a different reaction to fake nuts. Also got the start button to function.
I started with drawing the background as well as some sprites for the squirrel. I had some struggles with working with multiple files and linking everything right.

17.1. Today I got my last few things together, so i got my starting screen as well as retry button to work and also connected the first animation to the start.
I was also rearranging my code into the right files as well as connecting everything successfully.

20.1. I started with my spritesheet for my first animation - the squirrel waves when you load the starting screen. I also continued drawing my
background as well as started with my second spritesheet - squirrels reaction to collected things.

21.1. Today I mainly struggled with my spritesheet as i created everything on procreate and i had to be very
exact with my pixels etc. I implemented all animations, all this took my almost the whole day. After that I continued 
with my background drawing.

22.1. Momo helped me with the sprites, I did the start Screen as well as added all the drawn nuts and heats, timer etc. My biggest
issue is still! ;( After getting feedback from Lukas, he told me that its not quite possible to make it not pixely. I conituned with
drawing the background in layers.

23.1. Today I finished my drawing and Momo helped me implement all the images as their own layer. I continued to edit the Lose/Winning
Screen and had to put every nut as well as blocker exactly on their designated place. People were also trying my game out, to let me know
if 2 mins is too much or nut. I finishedddddddd
